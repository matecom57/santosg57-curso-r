EXAMPLE 2.2.1

Table 1.4.1 contains a list of the ages of subjects who participated in the study on smok-
ing cessation discussed in Example 1.4.1. As can be seen, this unordered table requires
considerable searching for us to ascertain such elementary information as the age of the
youngest and oldest subjects.


2.3 GROUPED DATA: THE FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION

EXAMPLE 2.3.1
We wish to know how many class intervals to have in the frequency distribution of the
data. We also want to know how wide the intervals should be.

formula given by Sturges: :math:`k = 1 + 3.3221 (\log_{10} n)`, where k stands for the number of class intervals and n is the
number of values in the data set under consideration.
