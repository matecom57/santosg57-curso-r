REGRESIÓN MÚLTIPLE Y CORRELACIÓN
================================

Modelo matemático

.. math::

   y_j = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1j} +  \beta_2 x_{2j} + ... +  \beta_k x_{kj} + \varepsilon_j


**OBTENCIÓN DE LA ECUACIÓN DE REGRESIÓN MÚLTIPLE**

**EXAMPLE 10.3.1**

Researchers Jansen and Keller (A-1) used age and education level to predict the capacity to direct attention (CDA) 
in elderly subjects. CDA refers to neural inhibitory mechanisms that focus the mind on what is meaningful while 
blocking out distractions. The study collected information on 71 community-dwelling older women with normal mental 
status. The CDA measurement was calculated from results on standard visual and auditory measures requiring the 
inhibition of competing and distracting stimuli. In this study, CDA scores ranged from -7.65 to 9.61 with higher 
scores corresponding with better attentional functioning. The measurements on CDA, age in years, and education 
level (years of schooling) for 71 subjects are shown in Table 10.3.1. We wish to obtain the sample multiple 
regression equation.
